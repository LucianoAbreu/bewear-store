## 🔧 Development Approach

### 🧱 Component-Based Architecture

The UI is built with modular and reusable components (buttons, cards, inputs, modals, etc.) to promote scalability and maintainability.

### 📲 Mobile First

Layout is designed mobile-first, ensuring responsiveness and better user experience on all devices.

### 🧠 Atomic Design Principles

Following Atomic Design methodology (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms), components are structured to simplify development and encourage clarity.

### 🧼 Clean Code & Folder Structure

- Type-safe logic via **TypeScript**
- Descriptive naming, clean architecture, and a domain-based folder structure
- Clear separation between business logic, presentation, and data layers

### 🌐 SEO-Driven Architecture

Using **Next.js** for server-side rendering and static generation ensures that search engines index pages efficiently — improving overall discoverability.

### 🌈 UI Frameworks

Built with **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling, combined with **Shadcn/ui** for accessible and customizable components.

### 🧪 Future-Proofing

Project is developed with future enhancements in mind, including:

- 🔮 AI-powered chatbot for shopping assistance
- 📊 Admin dashboard for database management
- ✨ Smooth UI/UX animations
